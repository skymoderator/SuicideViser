## Suicide District
A tree map that shows suicide count across hierarchical geometric level
| Features | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Switching Granularity | <img src="Screenshot/district.gif"> |
| Showing Percentage | <img src="Screenshot/district_percentage.png"> |
| Sorting | <img src="Screenshot/district_sorting.gif" width="50%"><img src="Screenshot/district_sorting2.gif" width="50%">  |
| Map View | <img src="Screenshot/district_map.png"> |
| Showing Suicide Rate Or Count | <img src="Screenshot/district_count_n_rate.gif">  Notice the legend changes accordingly |
| Sort By Suicide Rate/Count or District Income | <img src="Screenshot/district_sortby.gif"> |

Note: We follow the definition from [WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/4664#:~:text=Definition%3A,and%20multiplied%20by%20100%20000) to calculate the Suicide Rate = Suicide Count / District Population * 100,000

ðŸ”¦ **Idiom**:
- `Overview First, Zoom and Filter, Detail on Demand`: We show the area level information (overview) first. If users are interested in detail, they can pinch to zoom, or toggle the picker in config to switch granularity. This ensure that users are not overwhelmed.

ðŸŽ¨ **Color Scheme**:
- `Sequential Color Scale`: We divide the whole color spectrum into 3 parts, each corresponds to a geometric granularity:
    - Level `Area`: Red to yellow
    - Level `District`: green to cyan
    - Level `Sub District`: blue to purple

## Suicide Age & District
A stacked bar chart that shows suicide count across age groups and districts

| Features | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Show Percentage | <img src="Screenshot/districtnage_percentage.gif"> |
| Sort Within District or Globally | <img src="Screenshot/districtnage_sort.gif"> |
| Sort Ascendingly or Descendingly | <img src="Screenshot/distictnage_sortorder.gif"> |
| Tooltip | <img src="Screenshot/districtnage_tooltip.jpeg"> |

ðŸ”¦ **Idiom**:
- `Change order/arrangement`: Support flexible comparison, trend, extreme values.
- `Animated transitions`: Smooth transition from one state to another to reduce cognitive load

ðŸŽ¨ **Color Scheme**:
- `Sequential Color Scale`: enforce ordering in terms of suicide count
- Align with our daily convention that the color of red symbolise death or something caution, matching the nature of suicide
